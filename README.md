> I finally give up that delusion of being perfect. I'm not. Actually I'm bad and I tend to lie to myself. 'I'm just a student who is trying to be better.' Really? `pretend to be` may better describe ... I'm not a genius, I'm not a prodigy, I'm not a perfect student

## HW

- ### HW 1 : Java Syntax and Sound Synthesis

    ASAG: The rumors are true.

- ### HW 2 : Percolation

    It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

- ### Makeup Lab 15 : HugLife

    `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` The autograder failed to execute correctly. Contact your course staff for help in debugging this issue. Make sure to include a link to this page so that they can help you most effectively.

## Project

- ### Project 0 : NBody

    Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... So where shall I put you?

    ***April Fools!***

    These problems are known NP-Complete problems, which means they're (probably)
    not solvable in the runtimes we gave to you, or any polynomial runtime. Solving
    them in any polynomial runtime is equivalent to proving that P = NP, a famous
    unsolved problem in computer science.

    Please don't work on them too hard. For your reference, if you do manage to solve
    one of these problems in an acceptable runtime, you can win $1 million dollars
    from the Millenium Problems challenge.
