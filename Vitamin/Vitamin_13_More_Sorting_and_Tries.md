# Q2 Sorting Lower Bound

Comparison based sorting can be likened to an algorithm that uses yes or no questions. Therefore, for an input of size N, we can establish a lower bound of Ω ()

Answer: n log n

Q3 Radix Sorting:

In the very best case, given an input of size N and an alphabet of size K, MSD sorting has a runtime of Θ ()

Answer: N

Q4 Tries:

Tries are analogous to  sort.

Answer: Radix

Q5 More Tries!:

Typically in a trie, letters are stored implicitly on (nodes or edges?)

Answer: Edges
