## Q1 Shortest Paths

When we have a single target in mind for shortest paths, we would usually rather use over Dijkstra's algorithm.

Answer: Breadth-first search (BFS)

## Q2 Kruskal's Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm finds a  of a graph.

Answer: Minimum spanning tree (MST)

## Q3 `A* Heuristic`

In the `A*` algorithm, a heuristic which overestimates is

Answer: Admissible

## Q4 Dijkstra's Runtime

Assuming E > V, the runtime of Dijkstra's algorithm is

Answer: `E*logV`
